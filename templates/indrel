Dear {recruiter_name},

My name is {your_first_name}, and I represent UC Berkeley's Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Honor Society, Eta Kappa Nu (HKN). I am reaching out to you because HKN would like to partner with {company_name} this upcoming Spring semester, to help you connect with our student body for any internship or full-time job opportunities you may have available.

UC Berkeley’s EECS curriculum and department is one of the most highly ranked and competitive programs in the country, and HKN members belong to the top quarter of the Junior and top third of the Senior undergraduate class. In the past two years, we've hosted over 60 events with an average attendance of over 50 students each.

If you are interested in partnering with us to recruit at UC Berkeley, we could organize larger events like tech talks, or more personal one-on-one coffee chats or dinner events. You can read about the recruiting events that have worked well in the past at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BS7L5iysja_7UDQT2hQ_eduhv48i4vhl/view.

These are just a few of the options, and I’d love to jump on a call and learn more about what kind of event you’re looking to host to see how we can best help you. 

Also, HKN organizes outreach events for local high school and middle school students to pursue their interests in electrical engineering and computer science. If you are interested in sponsoring or donating equipment for these events, we’d love to connect you with our Service event team. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me. We look forward to hearing from you!


Best,
